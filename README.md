# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if we could accurately predict if someone would be a successful or unsuccessful applicant for a charity by using TensorFlow and neural networks.

## Results

</p>
* The most successful model that we created had two hidden layers. The first hidden layer had 8 neurons and the second had 4 neurons. Both of the hidden layers used the relu activation function, whilst the output layer used a sigmoid activation function

</p>
* The model had an accuracy level of 70%
* Steps that were used to try to increase the accuacy of the model included adding additional hidden layers and adding more neurons in each layer. After trying to add more layers and add more neurons, I tried to deccrease the amount of neurons that I was using and the amount of layers. This proved to be the most successful course of action.  

## Summary
In summary, although we were able to get the accuracy up to 70%, it is still difficult to accurately predict a successful or unsuccessful applicant.
